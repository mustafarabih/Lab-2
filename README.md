## ЛАБ 2
In this lab we did deep learning of our first model using:
I used the following algorithms as my models:

Dummy Classifer       
KNN        
Decision Tree         
Logistic Regression 

i created a models to predict the quality of the wines and got the following scores:

Dummy Classifer:       50.0 %

KNN:                   98.7 %

Decision Tree:         97.6 %

Logistic Regression:   98.3 %
It can be concluded that KNN is the most accurate model for our dataset, with 98.7 percentages of success.But thid doesn't mean that there're not other better Algorithm out there
